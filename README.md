# Challenge

The Internet has profoundly changed the way we buy things, but the online shopping of today is likely not the end of that change; after each purchase we still need to wait multiple days for physical goods to be carried to our doorstep.
This is where drones come in ­ autonomous, electric vehicles delivering online purchases. Flying, so never stuck in traffic. As drone technology improves every year, there remains a major issue: how do we manage and coordinate all those drones?

Given a hypothetical fleet of drones, a list of customer orders and availability of the individual products in warehouses, your task is to schedule the drone operations so that the orders are completed as soon as possible. You will need to handle the complications of multiple drones, customer orders, product types and weights, warehouses, and delivery destinations.
